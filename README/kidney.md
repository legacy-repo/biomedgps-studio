## Kidney

The kidneys are considered a particularly vulnerable target to the toxic effects that PM2.5 exerts，inducing kidney function decline, increasing the risk of suffering from chronic kidney diseases and promoting the occurrence and development of various renal tumors. The mechanism of PM2.5-induced renal injury may involve oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and cytotoxicity. Alteration of kidney function may lead to a disrupted homeostasis, affecting disparate tissues in the body[<sup>1</sup>](#ref-1)[<sup>2</sup>](#ref-2).
