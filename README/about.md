## RAPEX - Response to Air Pollution EXposure

RAPEX is a newly developed interactive web server for focusing on pollution-caused damage within and across organ, as well as inter-species by RNA-seq analysis. Target users are researchers interested in air pollution health outputs on gene level. Researchers can access datasets we generated from mice in lab, as well as selected from various sources in the server. Upon selecting datasets, featured interactive visual outputs on rich differential gene analysis integrated in the platform are displayed. Analysis portion is consistent of three parts, single gene analysis most useful for inter-organ analysis, multiple gene differential analysis, and custom analysis allowing customized inputs and settings. 

RAPEX has several customizable functions:
1. Unique generated and attentively selected datasets. Users can access our high-quality RNA-Seq datasets generated from our mice lab. Other datasets provided for further analysis are selected from publications on various journal and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and are intrinsically categorized by organ, species, sample type, etc. Users do not have to have their own datasets. 

2. Knowledge graph linking genes to publications. As a one stop web server, after obtaining the results, RAPEX offers a knowledge graph in which users can review publications and other works that have mentioned such genes in interest.

3. Interactive visualization outputs. Unlike most of outputs provided in other tools, RAPEX provides interactive charts, leading users to other portions of the platform for further analysis. In addition, downloadable outputs are highly modifiable in terms of color, axis, etc.
In summary, RAPEX is an one-stop RNA-Seq analysis tool that assists researchers and clinicians in discovering organ-specific, inter-organ and inter-species damage patterns caused by air pollution.

The RAPEX platform is developed by Jingcheng Yang (Fudan University), Jun Shang (Fudan University), Tianyuan Chen (Johns Hopkins University), Yiqing Zhang (Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences), Yuqin Huang (Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences), Haonan Chen (Fudan University), Zihan Ran (Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences).
