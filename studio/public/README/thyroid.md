## Thyroid

Thyroid function parameters are associated with PM 2.5 exposure. An increase of 10 μg/m3 in fne particulate matter≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) was associated with a decrease of 0.12 pmol/L in FT4 and an increase of 0.07 pmol/L in FT3 (both P<0.01)[<sup>1</sup>](#ref-1). PM 2.5 also contribute to the high prevalence of thyroid nodules in China[<sup>2</sup>](#ref-2). Moreover, prenatal PM exposure, particularly in early pregnancy and midpregnancy, is associated with higher newborn TT4 concentrations. PM2.5 exposure during months 3 to 7 of pregnancy and PM10 exposure during months 1 to 8 of pregnancy were associated with significantly higher newborn TT4 concentrations (P < 0.005)[<sup>3</sup>](#ref-3).
