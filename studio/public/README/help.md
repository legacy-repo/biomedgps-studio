## Quick Start

Statement: All the datasets on the RAPEX platform are computed by [r-omics-utils](https://github.com/yjcyxky/r-omics-utils.git). Use the Google Chrome browser for best visualization quality and experience.

RAPEX is a newly developed interactive web server for focusing on pollution-caused damage within and across organ, as well as inter-species by RNA-seq analysis. Target users are researchers interested in air pollution health outputs on gene level. Researchers can access datasets we generated from mice in lab, as well as selected from various sources in the server. Upon selecting datasets, featured interactive visual outputs on rich differential gene analysis integrated in the platform are displayed. Analysis portion is consistent of three parts, single gene analysis most useful for inter-organ analysis, multiple gene differential analysis, and custom analysis allowing customized inputs and settings.
