## Testis

Recent studies have shown that PM2.5 will accumulate in the reproductive organs through blood-testis barrier, placental barrier, epithelial barrier and other barriers protecting reproductive tissues. In addition, PM2.5 can disrupt hormone levels, ultimately affecting fertility. Prior studies have shown that oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and the breakdown of barrier structures are now considered to contribute to reproductive toxicity and may cause damage at the molecular and genetic levels<sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.
